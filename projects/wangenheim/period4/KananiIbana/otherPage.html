<h1>Career Page</h1>
<p> The career I chose is photography. I chose photography because I loved the art, originality, and creativity of photographers. Photographers do not make the best money but they do make a good amount. They make about twenty-six dollars per hour. Photographers need a high school diploma or equivalent. Photographers use their technical expertise, creativity as I repeated, and compositiion skills to produce and perserve their images/photos. Some similar jobs are Architects, which you need a bachelor's degree for. A Art Director, you also need a bachelor degree. Lastly, a Desktop publisher, for this job, you need an associates degree.   </p>
