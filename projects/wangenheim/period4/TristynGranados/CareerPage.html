    <p>     I picked art director. I would need my Bachelors degree if i were to do this job.The average salery is $92,780 a year or $44.60 an hour. Some things they do are choose which art, photos, or other thngs fit best with the project. They also talk to clients to see what they would like in the project. Then, they review over the designs and approve them.   </p>
