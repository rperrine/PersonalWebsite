<h1>What I want as my career</h1>
<p> I want to be a film and video editor. I know how to edit videos, and I think I can use that to my advantage in the job market. I always loved making videos, but I love editing them much more. I take inspiration from corridor digital. The entry level for being a video editor is a bachelor's degree. The pay isn't that much because its only $19.57, but I think I can make my own company and earn much more.
