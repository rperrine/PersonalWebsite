<h1> Welcome to my Career Page!</h1>
<h4> Where you can find all of my interests and my career path!</h4>
<h4>I have some pictures of what I might want to make!</h4>
<h4> I'm even learning how to sew from my aunt!</h4> 
<p>I chose a fashion desinger because sewing/making clothes runs in the family. To be able to become a fashion designer, you need to have a Bachelor's Degree. 	Your salry yearly is $72,720, while you make $34.96 per hour. You work with other designers and make prototypes for fashion shows or trade shows. You also market your designers to consumers if you are able to make money from your work. You also study a type of fashion design that will draw comsumers to buy your work.</p>
