The career that I picked was a lawyer. 
You would need to have a doctor or professional degree. 
every year you would make about $120,910. every hour you would make about $58.13.
being a lawyer is extremely hard to do. you have to work really hard and put work into it and you might fail. This job can help keep innocent people out of jail . The out look for this career is 6%.
