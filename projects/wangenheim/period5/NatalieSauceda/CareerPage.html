<p>I will be talking about careers. My carreer I want when I get older it to be a cartoonist. For this career there is a education required. This education is a Bachelor's degree. This is required as a typical entry- level education. The average yearly salary for this career is 72,520. Per hour I would have paided 34.87. Important duties for this job is 1. using a computer to illustrations, 2. Research upcoming projects to help create realistic designs or animation. 3. Last but not least you need to work with a team of animators and artists to craete movies, games, or visual effect. The percantage for this job is 4% (as fast as average). That is all for the career needs but there's more where that came from.   </p>
