<h1>My Career Page</h1>
</body> I selected Market Manager as a Career. The average salary is $132,620 per a year. As a Market Manager, I would plan programs that will promote a product of a company. 
  To be one, I would need a bachelor degree. In the future, would more likely be succesful depending how I work. 
  Some jobs like engineering managers, computer and infomation managers,and compensation managers are just like this job that need a bachelor's degree.
