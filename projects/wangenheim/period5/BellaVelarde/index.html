<h1> Welcome to Bella's website!</h1>
I selected Psychiatrists
Psychiatrists are required to complete four years of undergraduate school, four years of medical school, and a further three to seven years of internship and specialized residency training. Once complete, many psychiatrists open private practices and work to help people in emotional or mental crisis.
I want to be a Psychiatrist because it is the second highest paying occupations and I want to be it because I want a better life and a good job with the highest paying occupations and I also want to be a Psychiatrist because my mom has been struugleing paying the house bills so maybe I can help her with the bills and give her money so she can keep her house and she can also have a good life. Plus I always wanted to have this job because I think it's going to be a fun chance of me learning new stuff and doing better things with my life. 
Psychiatrists get $200k to $300k per year and some other websites such as glassdoor is 100k to 150k
