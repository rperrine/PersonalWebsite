<p>The career I have selected is photography. Education is not required but many take certain classes "or earn a bachelor's degree to improve their skills." The average annual salery is $34.000. Photographers main duties are to advertise products, take professional quality photos, and use many techniques to enhance the subject. The outlook for photography jobs is not so good, the employment of them is said to go down by 6%, but self employed photographers is said to grow by 10%. SOme similar occupations are Art Directors they must have a bachelors degree, Architects who must have a bachelors degree, and Fashion Designers who have to have a bachelors degree as well.</p>
