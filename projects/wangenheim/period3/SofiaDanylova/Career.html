<h1>Welcome to my actual web page!</h1>
<p1>You know first I thought of being a norcologist, but it was not listed so now I'm an architect. So Yeah.<br>
</br>To be an architect I would need to have a Bachelor's degree. Each year I would earn $79,380, fine for me.
Architects prepare scaled drawings, either with computer software or by hand, visit worksites to ensure that 
construction adheres to architectural plans, and talk with clients. The job outlook is going to grow by 8 percent by 2028.</p1>
<br>
<p2>Similar jobs are Architectural and Engineering Manager it needs the same educational degree as normal Architect,
    also Civil Engineer job is similar you need the Bachelors dergree to be it.
Drafters are similar too and to be it you need an Associate's Degree.</p2>
</br>
<p3>By the way, look how cool Architects job is.</p3>
