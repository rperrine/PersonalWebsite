<h1>My inventory</h1>
<h2>I own a Nikon D70 which is an old camera(2006) currently equiped with 30mm fixed lenses, though its quality isn't the best it gets the job done, I also use the lenses that my dad also uses.</h2>
<h2>I have three batteries and one charging unit.</h2>
<h2>I have a computer built by my Dad to have a 750TI Geforce Nivdia graphics card, 15GBs of ram, a slightly bad cpu, and 3 TBs of storage, its not the best but is good for medium tasks. </h2>
