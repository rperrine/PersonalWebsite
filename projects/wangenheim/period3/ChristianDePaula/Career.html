<h1>Physicists and Astronomers!</h1>
<p>Physicists and astronomers require doctoral or professional degree.</p>
<p>If you manage to get the job your average salary per year $119,580 but every hour is $57.49.</p>
<p>The top 3 most important jobs for my career in my opinion is astrophysicists, atomic, molecular, and optical physicists, and galactic, planetary, solar, and stellar astronomers.</p>
